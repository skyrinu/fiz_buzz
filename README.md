# fiz_buzz
This is a FizzBuzz program I created in python the test my understanding of for
loop and range function in python.

# How does this program work?
This program asks the user a input for the range in which FizzBuzz are 
wanted to be generated in. The Numbers which are divided by 3, are printed 
as "Fizz". The Numbers which are divided by 5, are printed as "Buzz". The 
numbers which are divided by both, are printed as "FizzBuzz". At the last, 
rest of numbers are printed as it is.
